          <p>Hi everyone,</p>

          <p>I've added more people :)</p>

          <p>First of all to the new peeps (and old). I love you. I kept this from you because I didn't want you to freak out unnecessarily. I was diagnosed with cancer on Wednesday.</p>

          <p>
          Some of you have asked what you can do, and you've already done a lot in supporting me in life. For now just keep on rolling like you already do. I won't know the extent of my condition until after surgery and CT scans. Blood work has shown a shitty picture of what's going on, but it will be fine. 
          </p>

          <p>
          My main thing is that my parents don't worry. I've enlisted my sister and family to help me there. I'll ask one or two of you to join me at the surgery so they aren't there alone. 
          </p>

          <p>
          One of the interesting things I've had to do lately is think about stuff we normally wouldn't. I have a financial obligation, for instance, to write a Will. That was an enlightening exercise. But, it only showed me how much I have outside of anything tangible. Thank you for all your relationships and time. That will be how I get through this. Because I am well armored with your love. That, and surgery, and drugs, and a world class medical facility, and science. But you get the point ;) 
          </p>

          <p>
          At this point if it's pertinent: it's okay to tell people what's going on and that they should not worry. We'll cut out what we need to and kill the rest. That's the game plan and that's what's going to happen. 
          </p>

          <p>
          I've been given so much in life so I take this in stride. Life may give me lemons but I have vodka to mix. (can you make it a double?)
          </p>

          <p>
          Niket
          </p>

          <p>
          PS - Surgery is Monday. I should be coherent by Tuesday. I've been pretty drunk before so we'll see what the anesthetics can do.
