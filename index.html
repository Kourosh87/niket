          Hi Everyone,
          </p>

          <p>
          I'm glad to report that I'm feeling much better. Was able to walk and stand starting yesterday-ish and taking less and less drugs which is a good sign.
          </p>

          <p>
          I had my CT scans on Tuesday (I think?) and that was pretty neat. Got to go into what appeared to be a very expensive mechanical donut. They pumped me full of iodine (at this point I don't give a shit about needles anymore) which had the effect of making my whole body feel warm. Like taking a shot of whiskey, but injected into your blood stream. I highly recommend.
          </p>

          <p>
          I will get the results of that scan, which will tell us where the cancer has spread, on Monday along with the Pathology reports on my, ahem, ball, which tells us what kind of cancer we are dealing with. Those two things will give me a roadmap for treatment beyond (chemo, radiation, more surgery etc.).
          </p>

          <p>
          I hope the week is closing out well for everyone and you are excited about Thanks Giving. I'll be doing my best to recuperate so I can board a flight to ATL and see my folks out in the South.
          </p>

          <p>
          Much love,
          </p>

          PS - I am finally clear to take a shower. Fuck, I was going to lose it. I had to sponge bath before so I've attached this photo for visual representation of that.

          Hi,
          </p>

          <p>
          Thanks for all the kind thoughts and wishes. Unsurprisingly I was being impatient and bit too self confident post surgery. It hurts a little more than I let on :) [And Michael did a wonderful job conveying the scene in a much more flattering manner than I deserve].
          </p>

          <p>
          I get my CT scans tomorrow to figure out where the cancer has spread. My pathology reports come back next monday to illuminate the type of cancer and tell us how to treat it.
          </p>

          <p>
          Otherwise I've been at my place in Cupertino where I'm beginning to reflect a bit on all that is happening and doing my best to not get too serious about all of this. Thank you to everyone that has come visited and joined me during my bratty post-surgery performance (apparently I wanted to walk out of the hospital and go to taco bell).
          </p>

          <p>
          And furthermore thank you for all your kind thoughts, wishes, and love you have sent my way. It has been a really strong force that I am using to keep me in good spirits. I'm going to take the next few days of down time to really think hard about some of the things I'm doing in my life because I feel both invincible and completely vulnerable.
          </p>

          <p>
          Love,
          </p>

          </p>

          <p>
          PS - My aunt sent me this photo (that is attached) of me from long ago and the happiness I express there is the same happiness I have now thanks to all of you. A child's happiness, where the sorrows and reality of the world are momentarily suspended from our knowledge :)

          Hi friends,
          </p>

          <p>
          The surgeon just came out and informed us that the surgery was a success. Niket will need 30-45 minutes before he's ready to come out, but he's doing okay. This process isn't over yet, but this is a great start.
          </p>

          <p>
          Take care,
          </p>

          Hi friends,
          </p>

          <p>
          Niket has gone into surgery about 30 minutes ago. I gave him a big hug for all of us before he went in. It's about an hour long surgery and should be over shortly. We'll keep his well being in our thoughts and pray for the best.
          </p>

          <p>
          He will be a little out of sorts post surgery so it's best to not barrage him with calls. Please send your thoughts via email and I'm sure he'll be delighted to read them when he is in better shape.
          </p>

          <p>
          Please feel free to text me or email me at xxxxxxxxxx / mmizono@gmail.com if you have any questions or concerns.
          </p>

          <p>
          Much love,

          <p>Hi everyone,</p>

          <p>I've added more people :)</p>

          <p>First of all to the new peeps (and old). I love you. I kept this from you because I didn't want you to freak out unnecessarily. I was diagnosed with cancer on Wednesday.</p>

          <p>
          Some of you have asked what you can do, and you've already done a lot in supporting me in life. For now just keep on rolling like you already do. I won't know the extent of my condition until after surgery and CT scans. Blood work has shown a shitty picture of what's going on, but it will be fine.
          </p>

          <p>
          My main thing is that my parents don't worry. I've enlisted my sister and family to help me there. I'll ask one or two of you to join me at the surgery so they aren't there alone.
          </p>

          <p>
          One of the interesting things I've had to do lately is think about stuff we normally wouldn't. I have a financial obligation, for instance, to write a Will. That was an enlightening exercise. But, it only showed me how much I have outside of anything tangible. Thank you for all your relationships and time. That will be how I get through this. Because I am well armored with your love. That, and surgery, and drugs, and a world class medical facility, and science. But you get the point ;)
          </p>

          <p>
          At this point if it's pertinent: it's okay to tell people what's going on and that they should not worry. We'll cut out what we need to and kill the rest. That's the game plan and that's what's going to happen.
          </p>

          <p>
          I've been given so much in life so I take this in stride. Life may give me lemons but I have vodka to mix. (can you make it a double?)
          </p>

          <p>

          </p>

          <p>
          PS - Surgery is Monday. I should be coherent by Tuesday. I've been pretty drunk before so we'll see what the anesthetics can do.

          Hi everybody (channeling my dr. nick),
          </p>

          <p>
          I wish I could say things are getting better but unfortunately they're going to have to get worse first. I definitely have cancer. I'm going into surgery on Monday afternoon to remove one of my testicles and the chord up to the lymph nodes. I've taken some x-rays as well as given blood to help understand any potential spread, and will have a CT scan next week too. I have a host of methods to help in post treatment. My doc said I can't lift for a few weeks, sorry Michael.
          </p>

          <p>
          A lot of this hasn't struck me yet, but I'm okay. I'm more concerned for my parents who are probably freaking out a bit. I can't say I've been through worse, but I do like challenges.
          </p>

          <p>
          Lots of love this time.
          </p>

          Hi All,
          </p>

          <p>
          I've been fairly lucky in getting out of bad situations before.
          </p>

          <p>
          I got the results back from my ultrasound and it appears I have a large tumor in there. Next steps are to go in for immediate follow up tests to understand the extent of the growth and spread. I'll probably go under surgery in the next 6 days to cut as much of it out as possible and then get appropriate treatment from there.
          </p>

          <p>
          I'll know more tomorrow.
          </p>

          <p>
          Much love.
          </p>

          Hi everyone,
          </p>

          <p>
          I thought I'd write you so everyone can be on the same page and updated.
          </p>

          <p>
          As some of you know (or are about to find out) I've had some growth in one my testicles. Don't freak out yet: 99% chance it's not cancer.
          </p>

          <p>
          Normally, this type of growth is due to infection (clinically known as Epididymitis). However, initial testing (using antibiotics, some other drugs via shots, and culture samples) have ruled out the most common cases for this being infection, leading doctors to believe it's something else. They asked me if I have 'encountered significant physical trauma to the testicles lately' and I said no I haven't been kicked in the balls and I think I'd remember. (if anyone did do this while I was passed out, please do let me know).
          </p>

          <p>
          I'm going in for ultrasounds today which will check my lymph nodes and testes (this is so awkward to write about) to see what's going on. Depending on that I'll know what's going on next.
          </p>

          <p>
          Like I said, 99% chance this will just simply be an infection. I won't even speculate the 1% case, but begin 25 is a good age to handle any type of treatment necessary.
          </p>

          <p>
          I'll have more later. Love you all.
          </p>

          <p>

          </p>

          <p>
          PS - I really can't stress how awkward it is to be ass naked in a room full of people. It's the worst. Possibly worse than cancer.
          </p>

          <p>
          PPS - I've not BCCed people here because I want you to all know who you are. If we could keep this between us that would be best. I suspect this is nothing more than a reaction, and all will be good.
          </p>

          <p>
          PPPS - As a precaution, I am also taking some medications that will reduce the number of T cells in my body. I've been told I am allowed to drink though, so Cal game is still good to fucking go.
